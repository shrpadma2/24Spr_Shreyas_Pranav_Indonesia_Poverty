# Indonesia Poverty and Equity Program (P181107)

## Project Overview
This initiative focuses on examining Indonesia's progress and interconnectivity by scrutinizing various data sources like AIS (shipping data), household surveys, and census details. Our objective is to unearth pivotal trends, obstacles, and potential areas for advancement, particularly in terms of their effects on life quality and economic equity.

## Data Composition
The data, courtesy of William Hutchins Seitz, encompasses a range of health, education, and socio-economic data collected from villages to regencies, derived from PODES surveys conducted from 2011 to 2019.

## Purpose
The essence of this project is to leverage the collected data to ameliorate living standards by tackling imbalances in health, education, and economic welfare throughout Indonesia, with the ultimate goal of fostering equitable development.

## Methodology
Our method involves a series of procedures such as scrutinizing the data, amalgamating different datasets, incorporating satellite imagery, crafting maps and visual aids, and formulating statistical models to ensure a thorough analysis.

## Timeline
The project is structured to be completed within 12 weeks, with specific milestones for each stage of the project.

## Expected Number of Students
Two students are expected to collaborate on this project.

## Possible Issues
The main challenge anticipated is managing the data's complexity, given the vast number of variables and the extensive size of the PODES survey datasets.
